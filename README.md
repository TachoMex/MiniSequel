# MiniSequel: A SQL helper for Haskell

MiniSequel is a tool I've been coding during my spare time. I've been coding
Ruby on my job and I've used Sequel there, take a look if you want at 
- https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel
Feel free to coment any problem, suggestion or doubt you could have. The idea
of this tool is to provide usefull things in a beauty form, such as:

- Querying using haskell syntax
- Create models using haskell data objects
- Add migrations easily
- Connect to any DBMS that hdbc supports
- Mapping Sql vectors into Haskell objects

For now, I've barely coded models, adapter and basic queries support, I want to 
use this on a project so I can see the necesities as a programmer I could have
and provide tools for them. 

I consider myself as a newbie in haskell and I expect myself to learn while doing
this, feel free to tell when you see something made wrong, I love to learn from 
other people. 

When this is at a later state, where I get better felling of completness I'll
upload this to hackage (I hope).

Of course I'll upload some examples of queries and a little doc of how this works, 
I tryed to be intuitive and simple with the functionality. 


Well, that's all I have to say for now, don't hesitate if you have something to say.
